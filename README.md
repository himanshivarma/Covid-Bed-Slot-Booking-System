# Covid-Bed-Slot-Booking-System
The Covid-Bed-Slot-Booking-System is a database project designed to facilitate the efficient allocation and management of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. Amid the pandemic, there was a critical need to streamline the process of bed allocation, ensuring that patients could easily find available beds based on their medical needs and that hospitals could effectively manage their resources.

This system involves creating a database that stores information about hospitals, their bed capacities, types of beds (e.g., ICU, ventilator-equipped, regular), current occupancy status, patient details (if admitted), and available time slots for booking.

The project aims to:

1. Efficient Allocation: Enable users, such as healthcare professionals or patients' relatives, to check bed availability in various hospitals, book beds based on requirements, and manage reservations.

2. Real-time Updates: Maintain updated information regarding bed availability, occupancy status, and patient details in real-time to avoid overbooking or misinformation.

3. Streamlined Booking Process: Implement an intuitive user interface to facilitate easy booking, cancellation, and modification of bed reservations.

4. Reporting and Analytics: Incorporate analytical capabilities to generate reports on bed occupancy rates, peak utilization periods, and other key metrics. These insights can aid healthcare administrators in resource planning and decision-making.

As part of the training for candidates, they will learn SQL coding to manage and query databases effectively. Additionally, they'll gain familiarity with the Pharma domain and healthcare datasets, which are crucial for understanding the intricacies of medical data management. This training will equip candidates with a broad range of quantitative and analytical techniques necessary to analyze healthcare-related data and assist clients in making informed and data-driven decisions to improve healthcare services and resource allocation.
